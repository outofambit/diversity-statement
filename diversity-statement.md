# Commitment to Safer Spaces

In this class we make a commitment to inclusion by acknowledging the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. A collaborative effort between the students and the teacher is needed to create a supportive learning environment for all.

If a class member says that something is offensive, remember this is a valuable opportunity for everyone present to learn with further discussion.

All class members are strongly encouraged to discuss such instances with the instructor so they can be addressed with greater care in the future.
