# Commitment to Diversity and Safer Spaces

We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. We will use respect self-identifications, avoid disrespectful speech, and be mindful of special needs.

Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality. It is extremely important to remember that some people feel more protected—and others more vulnerable—during debates and discussions due to certain identities like race, gender, and class. Students and the instructor must collaborate to create a supportive learning environment for all.

If a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, remember this is a valuable opportunity for all people present to grow and learn from one another with further discussion. All class members are encouraged to discuss harmful instances with the instructor so they can be addressed with greater care in the future.
